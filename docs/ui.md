### [yUI - User Ynterface](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74357)

NVSE plugin that aims to fix UI bugs and add new UI features. Doesn't do anything
that noticeable on its own without [ySI - Sorting Ycons](#ysi---sorting-ycons).

#### Installation:

After installing the Main File, double-click the mod and go to **INI Editor**. Select all of the existing content and replace it with this:

```ini title="yUI.ini" showLineNumbers
[General]

; fix the issue where items with different conditions would 'jump around' on update
bFixIndefiniteSorting = 1

; fix the issue where Container Menu would display only a single dropped item at a time
bFixDroppedItems = 1

; fix the issue where Inventory Menu tabline shows up with buttons already selected
bFixTablineSelected = 1

; enable Sorting and Icons section which controls ySI, don't enable this if you don't have ySI installed unless you know what you are doing
bSortingIcons = 1

; match cursor color to HUD color
bMatchingCursor = 1


[Sorting and Icons]

; sort inventory according to tag names supplied in .json
bSortInventory = 1

; add ycons to inventory, container and barter menus
bAddInventoryIcons = 1

; replace hotkey icons with ycons
bReplaceHotkeyIcons = 1

; enable keyring-like clickable categories (this destroys vanilla keyring, so you have to have .json files supplying a new keyring category, i.e. ySI.json)
bEnableCategories = 1
```

### [ySI - Sorting Ycons](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74358)

Uses yUI features to add 140+ custom icons and advanced sorting logic to improve inventory
management. Make sure `bSortingIcons = 1` is enabled in [yUI.ini](#yui---user-ynterface)
(it should be if following the guide). Pick up the colorful icons too, looks really good in-game. Recommended with white HUD.
